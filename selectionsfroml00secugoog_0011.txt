quickly interpreting a Latin sentence. Α student whose mas·

tery of forms is reasonably good will have little difficulty in
‘ seeing their relation.

² Now comes‘in the skill and judgment oi the instructor. He

must detect at once just what point in each clause baffles the

student, and suggest the explanation in that way which will

ι best accomplish the desired enlightenment. It goes without

saying, that uniamiliar words must be immediately explained,
but the student can usually be made to reach their meaning in
some better way than by directly telling him„ All the resources
of the instructor’s pedagogical experience and powers oi sug-
gestiveness will be needed here.

At the very outset‚ the student must be made to appreciate
the Latin order of words, and taught to recognize the principles
which govern it. lt will probably be found that the best way
to accustom the student to the Latin order is to read the Latin
over and over, both before and after translation, until the real
relations of the words are impressed upon his mind. Further,
the student must be trained to note the salient points ol each
sentence or clause, and to hold in suspense all modifying expres·
sions until the skeleton is clearly seen. Many students stop
short because they do not see the use oi some adverb or adjec-
tive, instead of looking first lor the main structure ot the clause.
Only after this is plain, should the student try to discover what
modifying words attach themselves to subject or predicate, let-
ting the Latin order gulde him as much es possible. Alter a
little practice, with this in mind, the words will unconsciously
group themselves before his eye.

These principles can be made plain, by a skilful instructor,
in a short time. He should also, at the beginning, call the
attention ol the students to the more common peculiarities ol
l'liuy’s style, that they may be on the watch lor them.
