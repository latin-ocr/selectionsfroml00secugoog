INTRODUOTION.

——000—

Tun valuc and success of sight reading depend largely upon
the skill of the instructor. Properly employed, it is the most
valuable oi all class-room exercises. Its purpose is to accustom·
the pupil to catch the general drift oi the sentence from the
reading oi the Latin, and then to cultivate that quickness of
apprehension which enables nim to grasp its details. In no
other way can the Latin words be rnade to represent so effec-
tively a definite concept to the student’s eye aud mind.

The way to read Latin at sight is first to read the Latin
itseli aloud, slowly and distinctly, paying especial attention to
the correct pronunciation of each wordsand the proper combi-
nation of words according to their sense. Ii it is evident that
the student has failed to understand, in a general way, the
interdependence of the words, the instructor should either read
it himself, or, better still, correct the previous reading and have
the student read again aud again until he gets it right.

Then, for a time, a translation should be made.

The student must keep in mind, as he reads the Latin, the
principal elements of sentence construction, and endeavor‚ as
he reads, to discover these elemeuts in the sentence before hirn.
The difficulty with most students is that their preparation has
been so deficient that they have no thorough command of the
ordinary forms. They do not recognize a genitive at once as
such, nor a subjunctive as a subjunctive. This familiarity with
forms must be attained before one can be very successful in
